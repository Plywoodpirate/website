# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, slack, discord,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Workflow

We use [gitflow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) as our primary workflow.

## Pull Request Process

This process describes an ideal pull request: 

1. Fork the project locally, then make a branch for your work. Use a feature- or bugfix branch as described in 
   the [gitflow Workflow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/). Enter a speaking name for your branch.
   
2. **Test Driven Development:** Provide unit tests to demonstrate your problem or to test your new feature
   against the acceptance criteria.
   
3. Develop your fix or feature. After you have finished, make sure your tests from step 2 are running without failure.

4. Before committing, make sure your source code follows the [code style guides](../../wiki/contributing/code-style).

5. Provide documentation for your commit. This can be as little as a commit message (see style guide) or 
   phpdoc comments in your code. If necessary, please update the extension documentation or the 
   [project wiki](../../wiki/Home) and keep these docs up to date. Provide enough information about your changes 
   that anyone can understand *what* you did (not *how* you did it) even without reading your code.
   
7. Send a pull request to @michagrandel
